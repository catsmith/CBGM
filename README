INTRODUCTION
------------

This is my implementation of the CBGM. It was designed for testing and changing the 
various algorithms and is not (therefore) the fastest user-facing package. The idea
was that everything be calculated from scratch each time - although in later development
I added a Genealogical Coherence Cache for convenience (and speed). If you change the
input data then remember to delete the old cache...

INSTALL
-------

1) You need these packages installed (these are the Ubuntu names):
 - openmpi-bin
 - libopenmpi-dev
 - graphviz
2) You need a python 3.5 virtualenv, using the provided requirements.txt

USE
---

Run "./cbgm --help" for info, and for info about the subcommands do, for example,
"./cbgm combanc --help".

Also see the "examples" folder, including the README.sh in there, which can be executed
with bash to test the common CBGM features.
